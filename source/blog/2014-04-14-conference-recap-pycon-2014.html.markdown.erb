description: My first ever Python conference.
---

This weekend I attended and spoke at my first ever [PyCon](https://us.pycon.org/2014/). For those not familiar, PyCon is the largest annual gathering of the Python programming community. This year it was in Montr√©al.

I'm pretty wiped from the conf, so I don't have time for a longform post. Here are some stream of consciousness points and tweets.

Shout out to [Julia Elman](https://twitter.com/juliaelman) for convincing me to go and submit my talk. I wouldn't have been there without her. <3

[Girl Develop It](http://girldevelopit.com/) had a great presence at the conference. It was so wonderful to meet folks from other chapters in person and do some outreach.

[PyLadies](http://www.pyladies.com/) were in full force at the conference. They sponsored a bunch of scholarships, were speaking at the conference, helping out as organizers, and generally being awesome. The PyLadies lunch on Sunday was a great way to end the conference for me.

I won $500 for Pyladies from Heroku!

There were 1/3 women speakers and attendees! It was noticeable even without hearing those numbers. I hear the majority of this is due to Jessica McKellar and Pyladies. Thank you!

The geek feminism open space gave me a great place to go relax, decompress, and hang out with friends. Every conference needs this.

It was wonderful to see ALL THE FRIENDS. The tech feminist cabal (that title is a joke) was in full force and it was the best thing.

I spent $160 on a signed copy of Lean In. Don't worry, the proceeds go to benefit Pyladies. I donated the book to Double Union for corrections and edits. I kept the slipcover for potential future use.

I love the conference's dedication to their [code of conduct](https://us.pycon.org/2014/about/code-of-conduct/), especially after all the things that happened last year.

My only constructive criticism is that the conference could improve how they handle Q&A. Many people used the space as a mini lightning talk or asked multiple questions. A moderator that instructs people to be brief and actually *ask questions* might help. I totally understand this is a hard problem, and I rarely see it handled well (unless you count not having Q&A). Audience members don't tend to listen, so it's difficult to improve. I'd love the conf even if they can't fix this.

## Favorite talks
Here are some of my favorite talks listed in the order that I saw them. It's amazing how fast they [got videos up](http://www.pyvideo.org/category/50/pycon-us-2014), so that I could catch things I missed and share with all of you right away.

**[Naomi Ceder's Farewell and Welcome Home: Python in Two Genders](http://www.pyvideo.org/video/2671/farewell-and-welcome-home-python-in-two-genders)**

I missed seeing this talk live because of my early flight, and I'm really sad about that. Thankfully, videos were up quickly, and I got to watch it when I got home. It's so good. Everyone should watch this, but especially [cisgender](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cisgender) people.


## My talk
This was my first talk at a multitrack conference. I was a little nervous about people showing up because I was late in the day and would have competition. Thankfully, I had a full audience with a bunch of friends in the front row. It was an honor to have Naomi Ceder introduce me.

I think the talk went really well - I got a ton of positive feedback afterwards. I'm so thrilled that it resonated with people and really enjoyed the conversations we had afterwards. Thanks for creating a great environment for me to speak.

You can find my [slides](https://speakerdeck.com/juliepagano/its-dangerous-to-go-alone-battling-the-invisible-monsters-in-tech-pycon-2014) and [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1i8ylq4j_EY) online.


## Conclusion
I had a great time at PyCon. I want to go again next year. It convinced me that it's finally time to move communities. I tweeted the things below my last day at the conference. I stand by them.
