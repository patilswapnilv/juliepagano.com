      <h3>It's Dangerous to Go Alone: Battling the Invisible Monsters in Tech</h3>
      <p>We talk a lot about the things people can do to get the most out of being a software developer. We talk about testing, design patterns, contributing to open source, and many other topics. All of these things are important, but for some of us there's an important piece of the puzzle being overlooked. It can be hard to focus on your love of coding when you are regularly battling invisible issues like insecurity, anxiety, and lack of confidence. These issues create hurdles that get in the way no matter how much you improve as a software engineer.</p>

      <p>It is important that we talk about these issues because an unwillingness to admit they're real can make it worse. It makes them feel like the adult version of the monsters under the bed. It's scary and isolating because those around you don't understand or actively deny what you're going through. It's dangerous to go alone! Let's start talking about these issues, so people have the tools and support to fight back.</p>

      <p>You may have experienced these issues first-hand and need some help. You may want to learn more, so you can help others. This talk is for all of you. I'll identify invisible issues programmers struggle with, talk about their impact, discuss personal experiences dealing with them, and share some tools I found useful in fighting back.</p>

      <h3>My Technology Will Be Intersectional or It Will Be Bullshit!</h3>
      <p>People have been talking a lot about diversity in technology, but talking isn't enough. We need to move beyond focusing on one group and start getting everyone involved. It's not really diversity until we start to account for the intersections of different types of people and actively do something.</p>

      <p>In this talk, we will learn about intersectionality, discuss the importance of diversity, and identify things that we all can do to improve the situation. This talk will give you a reason to care about diversity and some tools to work towards improving it. It might even inspire you to join me in my rallying cry of "my technology will be intersectional or it will be BULLSHIT!"</p>

    <h2>Talk Ideas</h2>
    <p>Talk ideas I am playing around with and may consider giving in the future. Let me know if you're interested in an idea!</p>

      <h3>Speaker Support of Awesomeness: How I went from stage fright to stage presence and want to help others do the same</h3>
      <p>Once upon a time, I was terrified of public speaking. I went from having stage fright to being a stage presence who speaks at conferences. I run a support group for old and new speakers called the "Tech Conf Speaker Support of Awesomeness." I want to talk about what we do, why we do it, and how well it's worked out so far. This talk is about speaking for the first time, improving your talks, and how conference organizers and attendees can help too.</p>
      <p>I want to make conferences more fun, more interesting, and more diverse. I'm sick of the same old speakers giving the same talks over and over. I want to hear new voices giving different perspectives. A great way to do that is supporting new speakers and giving them the tools to be awesome.</p>
      <p>In this talk, I will share advice for speakers and people who want to support them including, but not limited to:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Why encouraging new speakers (including yourself) is important and how you can help.</li>
          <li>How to battle stage fright, impostor syndrome, and other nasty monsters.</li>
          <li>Tips and tricks for a great first talk (ideas, and slides, and presentation skills, oh my!).</li>
        </ul>
      <p>My advice comes from experiences in several roles that help me understand public speaking for different perspectives.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>New speaker - I went from terrified of public speaking to giving three well-received conference talks in a year.</li>
        <li>Support group organizer - I organize an online support group that helps both new and experienced speakers.</li>
        <li>Conference organizer - I was a conference organizer for two years and facilitated the proposal and selection process.</li>
        <li>Audience member - I attend several conferences a year and have identified some patterns for great talks (and anti-patterns for the not-so-great ones).</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Want to start public speaking, but not sure where to start? Sick of seeing the same people speaking all the time? Frustrated with poorly prepared talks? Excited to improve the diversity of voices and ideas on stage? Then this is the talk for you!</p>
