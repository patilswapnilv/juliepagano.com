    <p>The topic of bad &ldquo;allies&rdquo; has come up a lot lately. Some people want to know how to identify bad allies.
Others want to know if they are being bad allies. Below is a list of common issues in the ever popular
internet quiz style to help you determine if yourself or someone else might be a bad ally.</p>

<p>This is not about any one specific person. It is a collection of issues myself and others
have seen repeatedly from people claiming to be allies. If you take this personally or think
it&rsquo;s about you, you might just be a bad ally.</p>

<p>So come one, come all, and take the bad ally quiz! The points are mostly made up, but they sure do matter!</p>

<h2 id="quiz">Quiz</h2>

<p>Give yourself points for each item that applies, even if it only applies sometimes. Items without a specified value are worth 1 point. For points assigned &ldquo;per incident,&rdquo; count all incidents from the last year. Be honest.</p>

<h3 id="words">Words</h3>

<ul>
<li>Do you spend a lot of time telling people what a &ldquo;good ally&rdquo; you are?</li>
<li>Do you claim that you never make mistakes or act in an oppressive way?</li>
<li>Do you complain about spaces that only allow members of an oppressed group because you cannot be involved?</li>
<li>Do you use patronizing language (e.g. referring to an adult as a child) when speaking with or about people in the group you are allied to? <em>(20 points per incident)</em></li>
<li>Do you use slurs when speaking with or about people in the group you are allied to? <em>(1000 points per incident)</em>.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="interactions-with-the-people-you-are-allied-with">Interactions with the people you are allied with</h3>

<ul>
<li>Do you demand that people educate you (instead of seeking to educate yourself)?</li>
<li>Do you demand they give you time or attention (e.g. expecting advice on demand, requesting they give you personalized reviews of articles)?</li>
<li>Do you tell them to fix a specific issue because they are part of a group (e.g. demanding they speak at a conference, insisting they write a post on a specific topic)? <em>(10 points per incident)</em></li>
<li>Do you tell them how to speak or behave?</li>
<li>Do you <a href="http://geekfeminism.wikia.com/wiki/Tone_argument">tone police</a> (e.g. telling them to be nicer, &ldquo;you&rsquo;ll catch more flies with honey&rdquo;)?</li>
<li>Do you <a href="http://geekfeminism.wikia.com/wiki/Concern_troll">concern troll</a>?</li>
<li>Do you accuse people of overreacting, being too sensitive, or blowing things out of proportion?</li>
<li>Do you only ally yourself with members of the group who fit your idea of a &ldquo;model minority&rdquo; (look, act, and/or behave a certain way) or who agree with you?</li>
<li>Do you treat the group like a monolith (i.e. assume they all think and act the same way and want the same things)?</li>
<li>Do you dismiss their personal experiences?</li>
<li>Do you tell them what tactics to use when fighting oppression?</li>
<li>Do you use other members of the group to validate your behavior (e.g. I have a black friend, I&rsquo;m married to a woman)?</li>
<li>Do you demand praise or acknowledgment of your allyship or specific acts as an ally?</li>
<li>Do you tend to dominate conversations instead of letting others speak?</li>
<li>Do you play &ldquo;<a href="http://www.shakesville.com/2013/10/liss-says-stuff-3-devils-advocate.html">devil&rsquo;s advocate</a>&rdquo; when discussing issues important to them?</li>
<li>Do you ask people about sensitive issues (e.g. assault, genitalia, sexuality)? <em>(10 points)</em></li>
<li>Do you push or disrespect their boundaries (e.g. continuing a conversation when asked to stop, touching someone without permission)? <em>(30 points per incident)</em>.</li>
<li>Have members of the group you are allied with called you a bad ally or said you were not an ally at all? <em>(100 points per incident)</em></li>
</ul>

<h3 id="making-mistakes">Making mistakes</h3>

<ul>
<li>Have you mentioned your status as an ally when called out on mistakes or bad behavior? <em>(5 points per incident)</em></li>
<li>Do you try to play off mistakes as a joke? <em>(10 points)</em></li>
<li>Do you act defensively when called out on mistakes or bad behavior? <em>(5 points)</em></li>
<li>Do you get angry and lash out when called out on mistakes or bad behavior? <em>(20 points per incident)</em></li>
<li>Do you make the same mistakes over and over again? <em>(10 points)</em></li>
</ul>

<h3 id="actions">Actions</h3>

<ul>
<li>Do you fail to evaluate and understand your privilege?</li>
<li>Do you laugh at jokes at the expense of the group you are allied with?</li>
<li>Do you make jokes at the expense of the group you are allied with? <em>(10 points)</em> Frequently? <em>(100 points)</em></li>
<li>Do you sit quietly by when others say or do things that harm the group you are allied with?</li>
<li>Are you only a fair weather ally (i.e. you only help when things are easy or benefit you)? <em>(20 points)</em></li>
<li>Do you only call out bad behavior when someone is around to see it and provide you with praise for doing so?</li>
<li>Do you spend more time speaking for an oppressed group than listening to them or promoting their words?</li>
<li>Do you frequently speak/write/present about the oppressed group without first suggesting that a program/publication/event/etc. speak to members of that group instead? <em>(10 points per incident)</em></li>
<li>Do you take credit for the work of members of the group you are allied with? <em>(10 points per incident)</em> Without also giving them credit? <em>(100 points per incident)</em> While claiming they did not do the work? <em>(1000 points per incident)</em></li>
<li>Do you do things that actively harm members of the group you are allied with? <em>(100 points per incident)</em> Intentionally? <em>(1000 points per incident)</em></li>
</ul>

<h2 id="scoring">Scoring</h2>

<p>The higher your score, the less frequently you act as a good ally. Higher scores indicate you are probably
not an ally at all. Below are some arbitrary scoring breakdowns I came up with.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>0-1:</strong> Either you&rsquo;re an amazingly awesome ally or you lied on the quiz. The latter seems more likely &ndash; shame on you.</li>
<li><strong>2-10:</strong> You&rsquo;re doing a pretty good job, but remember that being an ally is an <a href="http://www.shakesville.com/2013/04/on-fixed-state-ally-model-vs-process.html">ongoing process</a>, so you should continue to work hard.</li>
<li><strong>11-24:</strong> You&rsquo;re making some mistakes and have room for improvement, but you are making good progress.</li>
<li><strong>25-49:</strong> You make a lot of mistakes, but might still act as an ally at times. You have a lot of room to improve. You should spend more time <a href="/blog/2013/11/02/101-off-limits/">educating yourself</a>.</li>
<li><strong>50-99:</strong> You are rarely or never an ally, but might be able to start developing your skills if you&rsquo;re willing to work hard. You need to spend a <em>lot</em> of time on <a href="/blog/2013/11/02/101-off-limits/">educating yourself</a>.</li>
<li><strong>100+:</strong> You&rsquo;re not ready to be an ally. Stop claiming you are. <a href="/blog/2013/11/02/101-off-limits/">Go educate yourself</a>.</li>
<li><strong>1000+:</strong> You&rsquo;re not even close to being an ally. In fact, you&rsquo;re probably actively harming members of the group you&rsquo;re supposedly allied with. STOP IT. Work on improving asap.</li>
<li><strong>5000+:</strong> You&rsquo;re not an ally. You&rsquo;re a shitty human being. What the fuck is wrong with you?</li>
</ul>
